# Interview Questions – Detailed Answers

## 1. What makes a password strong?

A strong password is designed to resist automated and manual guessing attempts. Key factors include:

- **Length:** Minimum 12–16 characters to increase the brute-force search space.
- **Complexity:** Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- **Unpredictability:** No dictionary words, patterns, birthdays, or personal info.
- **Uniqueness:** Never reuse the same password across multiple accounts.

A strong password is long, random, and unique.

## 2. What are common password attacks?

Common attack methods include:

- **Brute-Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations until it finds the correct one.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a wordlist of common or leaked passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses previously breached username/password pairs on other sites.
- **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing their passwords.
- **Keylogging/Malware:** Steals keystrokes or stored passwords.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepts credentials over insecure networks.

## 3. Why is password length important?

Password length increases the number of possible combinations exponentially.  
Longer passwords:

- Are significantly harder to brute-force.
- Offer better protection even without heavy complexity.
- Reduce guessability and resist automated attacks.

Even a simple but long password can outperform a short complex one.

## 4. What is a dictionary attack?

A dictionary attack is when an attacker uses a predefined list of common words, leaked passwords, or predictable patterns to guess a password.  
It is faster than brute-force because it targets likely passwords rather than random combinations.

## 5. What is multi-factor authentication?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires users to verify their identity using **two or more** authentication factors:

1. **Something you know:** Password or PIN  
2. **Something you have:** Phone, authenticator app, hardware key  
3. **Something you are:** Fingerprint, face recognition, biometrics  

MFA significantly reduces account compromise even if the password is leaked.

## 6. How do password managers help?

Password managers improve security by:

- Generating strong, unique, and random passwords.
- Storing passwords securely in encrypted vaults.
- Auto-filling credentials to avoid phishing.
- Eliminating password reuse.
- Syncing passwords across devices safely.

They reduce human error and simplify password management.

## 7. What are passphrases?

A passphrase is a long sequence of random or meaningful words, such as:  
`correct-horse-battery-staple`

Benefits:

- Much longer than typical passwords.
- Easier to remember.
- High entropy, making them very hard to crack.

Passphrases are strong because length > complexity.

## 8. What are common mistakes in password creation?

Common mistakes include:

- Using short or simple passwords.
- Using dictionary words or predictable patterns.
- Reusing the same password on multiple platforms.
- Adding obvious substitutions like `p@ssw0rd`.
- Using personal info: name, birthday, phone number.
- Using sequential characters like `123456` or `abcdef`.

Avoiding these mistakes greatly increases account security.
